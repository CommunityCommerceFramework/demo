============

A Magento 1 Demo installable via composer



## prebuild Databases

to reduce the time of the initial database creation, it provides some
small database dumps to speed up for example CI builds.

First is a rather empty one.

Second is filled with the smaple data from https://github.com/Vinai/compressed-magento-sample-data
Using this dump still needs the media and skin data from the smaple archive.
